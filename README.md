# ShoppingApp

It's small project for learning NgRx in cooperation with Angular 8.

#### Install all npm packages

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed globally. I use NPM to manage the dependencies, so I strongly recommend you to use it. You can install it from [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

#### Start DB server

Run `npm run db` for a start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). It is getting a full fake REST API with zero coding. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` if you want see DB.

#### Start development Angular server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4737/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
